## Welcome! 👋

I'm a software engineer with high proficiency in C++, Java and TypeScript. I especially have great interest in graphics programming.
I love good docs and neat user interface, so I always make at least decent ones, what's the point of an outstanding code if it can't be used?

- 🖥️ I code in C, C++, C#, Rust, Java, Python, Kotlin, Typescript (+HTML/CSS).
- 🎞️ I'm passionate about cinema. *Memories of Murder*, *Butterfly Effect* or *The Lord of the Rings* are among my favorite experiences.
- 💬 You can get in touch with me either at **Lycoon#7542** on Discord or **@LycoonMC** on Twitter.
