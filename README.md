### Hi you! 👋
> No matter how good is a project if it has good docs. - Someone

I'm **Hugo**, I'm currently studying computer science at EPITA, in Paris. I also work as a teaching assistant (ASM) for the 2nd year students, monitoring their exams and helping them out in C and Rust. I love good docs and neat user interface, so I always make at least decent ones, what's the point of an outstanding code if it can't be used?

- 🖥️ I code in C, Java, Rust, C#, Python, JS/HTML/CSS and starting Kotlin.
- 🎞️ I'm passionate about cinema. *Memories of Murder*, *Butterfly Effect* or *The Lord of the Rings* are among my favorite experiences.
- 💬 You can get in touch with me either at **Lycoon#7542** on Discord or **@LycoonMC** on Twitter.
